### 1. Account Setup <a name="account-setup"></a>
This is the first step where you create your Google Ads account. You need a Google account to set this up. If you don't have a Google account, you can create one [here](https://accounts.google.com/signup/v2/webcreateaccount?hl=en&flowName=GlifWebSignIn&flowEntry=SignUp).

### 2. Campaign Creation <a name="campaign-creation"></a>
In this step, you set up your ad campaigns. A campaign is a set of ad groups (ads, keywords, and bids) that share a budget, location targeting, and other settings. Campaigns are often used to organize categories of products or services that you offer.

---

### 3. Ad Group Creation <a name="ad-group-creation"></a>
Ad groups are subsets of your campaigns and contain one or more ads which target a shared set of keywords. You choose a keyword theme, create your ads, and set a bid of how much you're willing to pay per click for each ad in the ad group.

---

### 4. Keyword Selection <a name="keyword-selection"></a>
Keywords are words or phrases that are relevant to your product or service, which you choose to help determine where and when your ad can appear. When users search for those keywords, your ads may appear on the search results page.

---

### 5. Ad Creation <a name="ad-creation"></a>
This is where you create the actual content of your ads. You can choose from several types of ads depending on where you want your ad to appear and what you want your ad to accomplish. This can include text ads, image ads, video ads, etc.

---

### 6. Bidding <a name="bidding"></a>
This step involves deciding the maximum amount you're willing to pay each time a user clicks on your ad, also known as cost-per-click (CPC). Google Ads operates on an auction system, which takes place every time a user performs a keyword search. The auction determines which ads will be displayed, their placement, and the cost. In this auction, the winning ads are based on a combination of factors, including bid amount and ad quality (Quality Score). The actual CPC that you pay is often less than your max bid because it's enough to outperform the Ad Rank of the competitor below you. The formula is: `(Competitor Ad Rank / Your Quality Score) + $0.01`.

---

### 7. Quality Score <a name="quality-score"></a>
Quality Score is Google's rating of the quality and relevance of your keywords, ads, and landing pages. It is used in the ad auction to determine your Ad Rank. Factors that could affect your Quality Score include your click-through rate (CTR), the relevance of each keyword to its ad group, landing page quality and relevance, the relevance of your ad text, and your historical Google Ads account performance. In general, a high Quality Score can lead to lower costs and better ad positions.

---

### 8. Ad Rank <a name="ad-rank"></a>
Ad Rank is a value used to determine your ad position and whether your ads will show at all. It's calculated using your bid amount, the components of Quality Score (expected clickthrough rate, ad relevance, and landing page experience), and the expected impact of extensions and other ad formats. If two ads have the same quality and relevance, then the ad with the higher bid will appear in a higher position than the other.

---

### 9. Ad Serving <a name="ad-serving"></a>
Ad serving is the process of delivering ads to viewers through an ad server, which is a technology used by companies to manage and run online advertising campaigns. Ad servers are responsible for making instantaneous decisions about what ads to show based on various factors like the viewer's location, the website content, and the advertiser's budget.

---

### 10. Conversion Tracking <a name="conversion-tracking"></a>
Conversion tracking is a tool that shows you what happens after a customer interacts with your ads -- whether they purchased a product, signed up for your newsletter, called your business, or downloaded your app. When a customer completes an action that you've defined as valuable, these customer actions are called conversions.

---

### 11. Performance Reporting <a name="performance-reporting"></a>
Google Ads provides detailed reports about how your ads are performing. This includes metrics such as clicks, impressions, click-through rate (CTR), conversion rate, cost-per-conversion, etc. You can use this information to adjust and improve your campaigns.

---

### 12. Optimization <a name="optimization"></a>
Based on the performance reports, you can optimize your campaigns by adjusting keywords, bids, ad text, and other elements to improve results. You can also experiment with different ad formats and targeting options.
